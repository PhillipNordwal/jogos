# Contributing

I'm a huge fan of pull requests, especially for a coding menagerie such as this.

Fork, then clone this repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/jogos.git
```

Make your change(s).

* Make sure your change runs.
* Test your output against the output of existing solutions.
* Follow the style guidelines for your language.
* Make sure your code is as idiomatic for your language as possible.
* Add yourself to the README with instructions on how to run your solution.

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

[pr]: https://github.com/reillysiemens/jogos/compare

At this point you're waiting on me. I'll get to your pull request when I can.
Although unlikely I may ask you to fix merge conflicts before I accept your request.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Include a proper .gitignore with your language addition.
* Write legible code with proper variable names and good indentation.
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
